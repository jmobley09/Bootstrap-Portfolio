                    Back-end Developer who recently completed a Bachelors of Science in Information Technology. Diverse
                    background in customer service, enterprise IT support, and large-scale hardware deploying /
                    troubleshooting. This has generated a deeper understanding of development environments and how they
                    function within a business. Have an undergraduate Certificate in Advanced Systems Security and
                    working on a second one in Full Stack Development with University of Arizona. Able to work with
                    little to no supervision, meet objectives and deadlines, quickly able to learn and grasp new tasks;
                    Developers need to be able to meet deadlines as there is often several moving parts when apart of a
                    large scale team or project. Strong desire to continue to develop and advance, as a developer it is
                    required to do this as there is a constant need to learn new languages and solve complex problems.

                    In this Portfolio you will find a collection of all my projects. The links on the porfolio page
                    will take you to the live projects so that you can see them in action and underneath each will be a
                    link to the github repositories that you can view the source code with.
